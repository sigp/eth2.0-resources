# Testing Code for "get_new_shuffling"

This is a scrappy set of python scripts to gather results from the
`get_new_shuffling` function in the Eth 2.0 spec.

The spec updates frequently so you should make sure this version of code is
still valid. If it needs an update, feel free to submit a PR.

To run:

```
$ python get_new_shuffling.py
```
